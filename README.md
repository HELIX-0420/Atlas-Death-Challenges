##About
```
Atlas Death Challenges was made for the SMP I played with friends 
as we wanted to make it interesting to where every time you 
died you would need to do a challenge from the list that you create in the config.yml.

The plugin will Put the challenge on the Person who dided's screen when they 
respawned (You can customize what it will say).

And just to make sure they are not lying about what Challenge they got it 
will post it into the Server's chat for everyone to see as well.
